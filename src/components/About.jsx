      <h3> Hey! I'm Manoj â€” a self-taught web developer hailing from Chennai. Currently, I am pursuing my 3rd year Bachelor
       of Engineering in Electronics and Communication but for the past few months I spent a lot of time learning coding
       and I'm looking forward to implement what I've learnt and make new projects.
